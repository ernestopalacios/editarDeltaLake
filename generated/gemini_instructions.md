How to Use This Code
Install Libraries: Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed.

Bash

pip install streamlit pandas st-aggrid deltalake
Set Your Delta Lake Path: In the code, find the DELTA_TABLE_PATH variable and change "./dt" to the actual path of your Delta Lake table.

Configure Your Columns:

In the load_data_from_delta function, replace 'your_date_column' with the name of the date column you want to filter by.

In the save_data_to_delta function, ensure the predicate in write_deltalax uses your table's unique identifier (I've used 'id' as an example).

In the AgGrid configuration, adjust the gb.configure_column lines to make sure you are setting the correct columns as non-editable.

Run the App: Save the code as a Python file (e.g., app.py) and run it from your terminal:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
This application provides a solid foundation. You can expand it further by adding features like row deletion, more advanced filtering, or data validation before saving.
